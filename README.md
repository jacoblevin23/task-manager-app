## Steps in Setting Up MySQL Database

### 1. Make sure MySQL server is running locally.

Then run (on your command line):
mysql -u root < data/init_db.sql
This will create the database task_db and the tasks table.

### 3. Configure Database Access
Edit the file config/config.py:

DB_CONFIG = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "",  # Replace with your MySQL password if set
    "database": "task_db"
}

### 4. Install Dependencies
Ensure you‚Äôre using Python 3.8+

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 5. Run the Application
From the root of the project directory:

python3 main.py

You will see a command-line menu. Follow the prompts to interact with the task manager.
